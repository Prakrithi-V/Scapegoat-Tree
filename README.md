# Scapegoat-Tree
Implementation of Scapegoat Tree using C
A scapegoat tree is a self-balancing variant of the binary search tree. Unlike other variants like the red-black tree and the AVL tree, the scapegoat tree is an unencumbered data structure. That is, it doesn't need an extra storage per node in the tree. The low overhead and easy implementation makes the scapegoat tree a very attractive data structure
This is a project implementing the same in C
